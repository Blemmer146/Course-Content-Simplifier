beginner,biology,"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil to produce glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures light energy."
intermediate,physics,"Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This property is called inertia. The more massive an object is, the more inertia it has, making it harder to change its state of motion."
advanced,chemistry,"Molecular orbital theory describes chemical bonding by combining atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire molecule. When atomic orbitals combine, they form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. Electrons in bonding orbitals stabilize the molecule, while electrons in antibonding orbitals destabilize it."
beginner,mathematics,"Fractions represent parts of a whole number. The top number is called the numerator and shows how many parts you have. The bottom number is called the denominator and shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into. For example, in the fraction 3/4, you have 3 parts out of 4 equal parts total."
intermediate,history,"The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, marked a major turning point in human history. It transformed societies from agricultural and handicraft-based economies to machine-based manufacturing. Key innovations included the steam engine, textile machinery, and improved transportation systems like railways and canals."
